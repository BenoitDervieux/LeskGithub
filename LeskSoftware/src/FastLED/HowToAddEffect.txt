So here in this guide, at date of the 22nd of October 2024, I will describe how to add effects in the system.

1. Let's consider that the effect has already been added in the static file FastLedEffects.h and FastLedEffect.cpp
Now what we have to do is to add it in the system.

2. First we are going to go to stripesFA.cpp and add a new case for the effect we aim to add.
We need to take the name from there directly.

3. Then, we go to listeffects.h and we add the effect as a static structure.
Here, we need to put the informations:
- The name
- The number's name from the file defineeffects.h, should start by FX_ something
- The lambda's to be able to trigger the changes
- The setting's name to display
- The minimum values
- The maximum values
- The real name of each effect
- The number of effects

4. Add the getter and setters in the Settings.h

5. Add the variables and the initial value in the Setting.cpp

6. Set up the settingmap in the effectmanager.h
