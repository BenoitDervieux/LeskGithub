ToDo: 
** Implement the webserver (Asyncwebserver + websockets)
** Implement over the air (OTA)


ToDo Low Energy:
**Find new effect and map them

ToDo Not Coding: 
**Start learning graph theory
**Analyse WLED to see what to copy, both the APP and the code

I should implement now the HTML/Javascript logic to post thing and then activate the subscriber pattern.

Date 21/07/2024
Si the subscriber pattern functions now --> When I click on one of the "effect button" in the /effects link it refreshes the JSON doc
and using the subscriber pattern it refreshes the stripes.

Now, to fill up the programme, it would be good to: 
- Add more effects
- Add more collections
- Add more color mapping
- Add more effect mapping
- Add more setting mapping
- Put the brightness in HTML
- Put the play button in HTML
- Make the brightness logic for the stripes
- Make the stop logic for the stripes
- Increment and list this logic in all the instance we have: HTML, Parser and stripes
- Increment and list the logic for writing information in the JSON doc
- Check the HSV color model from the introduction to fastLed here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpXStjJ4Vc&list=PLgXkGn3BBAGi5dTOCuEwrLuFtfz0kGFTC&index=2
- Check the correction of the color (same video as HSV model)
- Having a speed converter for each effect, like if we have a curser which has a high speed, sometimes it can be traduced differently depending on the effect,
then we need to traduce for each effect.
- List a lot of palettes : possible tot use css gradient, minutes 6:30 on this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ukq0tH2Tnkc&list=PLgXkGn3BBAGi5dTOCuEwrLuFtfz0kGFTC&index=3
or here : https://fastled.io/tools/paletteknife/
- Check how to blend palette/effects : 5 minutes 30 here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRXJQVdwrog&list=PLgXkGn3BBAGi5dTOCuEwrLuFtfz0kGFTC&index=5
There a problem of memory here so let's look up how to use less memory
- Check how to integrate the blur1d function
- Be carefull to have some max value for some effects in order to not have epilepsy things
- Check the function .setMaximalPower to see what you can do with it and all the power supply functions
- Check the program blend_to_target_color from https://github.com/marmilicious/FastLED_examples for blending colors between effects
- Look this easy button library for the controller : https://github.com/ncmreynolds/EasyButton
- Find a better way to map the functions without hardcoding them (but complex as they are related to methods in a class)
